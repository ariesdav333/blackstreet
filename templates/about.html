                <h3>Teddy Riley</h3> <div class="black_img"><img src="\media\teddy.png" height="100" width="125"></div>
                <p>Edward Theodore Riley (born October 8, 1967) is an American singer-songwriter, musician, keyboardist, and record producer credited with the creation of the new jack swing genre. (Riley credits Barry Michael Cooper for giving it its name. He fused hip hop and R&B in his production work with artists including Michael Jackson, Bobby Brown, Doug E. Fresh, Today, Keith Sweat, Heavy D., Usher, and Jane Child, and his groups Guy and Blackstreet (although he was not the first to fuse rapping with singing); his consistency and drum ideas had some influence on modern-day R&B, which since him contained more samples and rapping segments as well as singing, a practice which in part was reminiscent of the then work of the Jackson family. Along with Neo Soul style of singers such as Marvin Gaye, he has had a seminal influence on gospel and R&B music, which became more open to using rap and sound effects in their recordings. One of the cliches of his work was how remixes of R&B songs and their original versions with a rap monologue, i.e. Right Here and Two Can Play That Game..</p>

                <h3>Chauncey Black</h3> <div class="black_img"><img src="\media\chauncey.png" height="100" width="125"></div>
               
                <p> Chauncey Black, co-founder and now sole owner of the Grammy-Award-winning group's name and CEO of Blackstreet Entertainment, explains the conflict with super-producer and co-founder Teddy Riley as a greedy power trip. 
                "Teddy Riley is hyped up on his other accomplishments [big name collaborations he's done outside of the group], so he's thinking that he alone is responsible for Guy and Blackstreet," Chauncey stated recently by phone from Atlanta. "He does play a large part in our success, but he's losing sight of the team efforts [made by himself, Mark Middleton and Eric Williams]. Yes, he's largely responsible for the music, but what do you have without our vocals? I'm a part of that sound and style, I was on every album and never left.".</p>

                <p> Before his Blackstreet days, Mark Middleton was a member of R&B group Brik Citi, who released one album in 1994 (Between a Rock and a Hard Place). In 1992, Middleton contributed background vocals for R&B singer Bruce Saunders on his album. His groupmate Eric Williams also sang background vocals on Saunders album. In 1996, new jack swing pioneer and founder and member of RandB groups Guy and Blackstreet Teddy Riley and Blackstreet's co-founder Chauncey Hannibal were looking for new members for Blackstreet after the departure of members Levi Little and Dave Hollister. The group first recruited Englewood, New Jersey native Williams, who was a good friend of Hannibal. Williams told Riley and Hannibal about Middleton who sang background vocals with him for Bruce Saunders. After hearing Middleton sing Riley and Hannibal were blown away by his talent and he became a member of Blackstreet. Middleton along with Eric Williams made their debut's with Blackstreet on the first single from their second album Another Level in the summer of 1996 called "No Diggity", featuring West Coast rapper Dr. Dre and Teddy Riley's protégée female rapper Queen Pen..</p>
